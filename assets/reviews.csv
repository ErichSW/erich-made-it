Samurai Jack,"2001-2004, 2017","Teen/YA, Adult (S5)",62 (Completed),Exceptional,Exceptional,Good,Good,Good,Good,Garbage,Aku (Mako Iwamatsu),100,"Uses minimalism to great effect for its storytelling, visual design, and plot threads. Ultimately succumbed to a nonsense ending due to budget constraints."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,2005-2008,Teen/YA,61 (Completed),Good,Good,Exceptional,Good,Good,Exceptional,Good,Iroh (Mako Iwamatsu),140,A rich world and scope of storytelling on par with LOTR or Harry Potter. I enjoyed it a lot.
Archer,2009-,Adult (Explicit),23,Bad,Good,Bad,Bad,Good,Exceptional,N/A,,20,Sitcom-styled show relying heavily on current events and adult humor. The visual style is efficient. Couldn't finish the 2nd season.
The Legend of Korra,2012-2014,Young Adult,52 (Completed),Good,Variable,Good,Good,Bad,Variable,Good,"Bolin, Varrick",60,"Sequel to Avatar. Progressive themes, ambitious world-building, and some fun characters, but overall poor execution."
Rick and Morty,2013-,Adult (Explicit),31,Good,Good,Good,Good,Exceptional,Bad,Good,Rick (Justin Roiland),100,"Clever reimagining of sci-fi stereotypes. Very funny, very self-aware, but begins to run out of ideas and rely too heavily on recurring jokes after the first couple seasons."
Bojack Horseman,2014-2020,Adult (Explicit),76 (Completed),Exceptional,Good,Exceptional,Exceptional,Exceptional,Exceptional,Exceptional,"Bojack, (Will Arnett)",220,You wouldn't expect a show where half the people are animals to be so human. It captures what it's like to make mistakes and live with the consequences. Great background gags and animal jokes. Lots of big name guest voices.
Disenchantment,2018-,YA/Adult,30,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,Variable,,60,Groening's story-driven dark age-fantasy comedy. It's got some good dark humor.

It's also an insane apocalyptic sci-fi epic. Poppy and fun style, great representation, deep and nuanced relationships, and a well-developed fantasy world."
Invincible,2021-,Adult (Explicit),8,Good,Bad,Good,Exceptional,Good,Good,Good,,70,World-of-superheroes type show with some great twists. Sometimes a bit gratuitous.
Big Mouth,2017-,Adult (Explicit),20,Good,Bad,Good,Variable,Good,Good,N/A,,30,Sex and sexuality. That's the gimmick. Get ready to see a lot of genitals.
My Adventures with Superman,2023-,Teen/YA,10,Good,Bad,Good,Variable,Good,Bad,N/A,,10,"Saturday morning cartoon reboot. It's pretty cute and easy to watch, but not a lot of substance."
Castlevania,2017-2021,Adult (Explicit),32 (Completed),Variable,Good,Good,Good,Garbage,Good,Good,Dracula (Graham McTavish),50,What made me happy: Dracula; all the cameos and easter eggs; vampire culture; the bonkers fight scenes animation; Sypha's perfect hair; What made me upset: Anytime anyone opened their mouths
Anime,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fist of the North Star,1984-1987,Shonen,109 (Completed),Bad,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,,50,"Classic story of love, revenge, and healing. Strong story arcs with memorable characters, but suffers from frequent reused footage and repetitive episodes."
Dragon Ball,1986-1989,Shonen,153 (Completed),Good,Good,Exceptional,Variable,Good,Good,Good,Master Roshi,110,Quirky and charming show in a fun pseudo-futuristic setting that never takes itself too seriously. The tournament arcs are the high points.
Dragon Ball Z,1989-1996,Shonen,291 (Completed),Variable,Good,Good,Good,Variable,Variable,Good,Cell (Dameon Clarke),70,"Shifts to higher stakes and crazier superpowers, getting more complex with each villain arc. Suffers from padding and inconsistant animation. The score would be much higher if it stopped at the Cell Games."
One Punch Man,"2015, 2019",Seinen,24 (Completed),Good,Good,Good,Bad,Exceptional,Good,Good,,70,"Takes everything you know about fighting anime and turns it on its head. Great novelty factor, but becomes pretty predictable after the first arc."
Mononoke,2007-2008,Seinen,12 (Completed),Exceptional,Exceptional,Good,Exceptional,Good,Variable,Good,,120,"Enigmatic and surreal, you will never see another show with a visual style quite like this. The mysteries are beautiful and captivating."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 & 2,2012-2013,Shonen,21 (Completed),Bad,Good,Variable,Exceptional,Good,Good,Exceptional,Dio (Patrick Seitz),110,Immediately throws you into a rapidly moving plot that only gets stranger and more absurd the longer you watch. 
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3,2014-2015,Shonen,48 (Completed),Bad,Good,Bad,Good,Bad,Variable,Good,Dio (Patrick Seitz),30,Decisively removes everything joyous and exciting about Parts 1 and 2 and replaces them with anime football commentary.
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 4,2016,Shonen,39 (Completed),Bad,Good,Good,Good,Good,Variable,Exceptional,,60,"Same concept as Part 3, with more effort put into developing a larger and more complex narrative. Emphasis on peaceful resolution."
Interviews with Monster Girls,2017,Slice of Life,12 (Completed),Good,Bad,Bad,Good,Good,Good,Bad,,10,Fanservice harem plot. Aimless and mediocre.
Berserk (Golden Age),1997-1998,Seinen (Explicit),25 (Completed),Exceptional,Good,Good,Exceptional,Exceptional,Exceptional,Variable,,140,"Takes you on an intense and intimate journey through the struggles, dreams, and conquests of three people searching for meaning in the world, and sets up for one of the most memorable finales in anime."
Nichijou,2011,Slice of Life,26 (Completed),Exceptional,Exceptional,Good,Good,Exceptional,Exceptional,Exceptional,,170,"It's funny, it's emotional, it's heartwarming, it's quotable. I don't know, it's just the fucking best."
Erased,2016,Seinen,12 (Completed),Good,Bad,Good,Exceptional,Exceptional,Exceptional,Good,,110,"Interesting time travel story. It strikes a good balance between charming and visceral, and does a good job of evoking a dawning and blood-chilling dread."
Keep your hands off Eizoken,2020,Seinen,12 (Completed),Good,Bad,Good,Exceptional,Exceptional,Good,Good,,90,"The anime about project management. Almost like a documentary, but is still pretty charming."
Deathnote,2006-2007,Shonen,unfinished,Bad,Good,Good,Exceptional,Variable,Variable,N/A,,40,What if you had the power to fix all the evils of the world? How absolutely does power corrupt? This show explores the realities of these dark fantasies.
Casshern Sins,2008-2009,Shonen,24 (Completed),Good,Exceptional,Bad,Bad,Variable,Bad,Bad,,0,"The world is dead, everyone is dying, and the show is just a bummer. The meat of the series is showing how various people deal with their own impending doom, ranging from hopeful to profoundly dark."
Spy x Family,2022-,Shonen,25,Bad,Bad,Exceptional,Exceptional,Good,Good,N/A,,60,All the classic spy tropes with a modern twist. It has this funny effect of showing how having ulterior motives can still have good outcomes when you're forced to play the long game.
