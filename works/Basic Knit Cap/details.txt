My first knit hat! After emotionally recovering from moving states and a minor worldwide pandemic, I decided to give knitting another try. A yarn shop in Bend called Wool Town offered beginner knitting classes, and over the course of about a month, I came out with my very own wearable thing that I can wear! I fell in love with pom-poms, and now put them on every hat I make. It just makes the world a little more fun.
