My first knit hat! After emotionally recovering from moving states and a minor worldwide pandemic, I decided to give knitting another try. A yarn shop in Bend called Wool Town offered beginner knitting classes, and over the course of about a month, I came out with my very own wearable thing that I can wear! As of today (1/11/25), I am still wearing it, and it is as cozy as ever.

Material: Alpaca/wool blend
