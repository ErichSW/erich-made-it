I like to knit in public. It's a great conversation starter, and people seem to place an inordinate amount of unearned trust in strangers with obsessive personalities holding weapons, as long as their medium is soft and squishy. Anyway, while I was working on a hat in a coffee shop, a man sitting across from me, with the boldness of a child seeing their first shiny toy package, blurted out, "If you give you money, will you make me a hat just like that one?" He got a hat, and I got money. Maybe this trust thing isn't so bad?
