I'm not sure why this took so long. I had this yarn since the wide-eyed and wonderous days of swatch learning, but I never found the right place for it. I'm not even sure what it's made of. But damn, it turned into a nice ribbed snowboarder hat. I gave it to a true gnar spreader.

Material: Don't remember
