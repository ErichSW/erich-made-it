I'm not sure why this took so long. I had this yarn since the wide-eyed and wonderous days of swatch learning, but I never found the right place for it. It's a self-striping sock weight, and very much wanted to become socks. The final result looked to me like something a snowboarder would wear. I gave it to a true gnar spreader.
