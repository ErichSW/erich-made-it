It's a looong scarf! This project taught me how to change colors at a new row. It seemed scary until I tried it, after which I felt incredibly embarressed that I ever made a big deal of it. It also taught me that no matter how long you think your scarf should be, it should be longer.

Material: Wool and cotton blend
