Every knitter starts somewhere! My friend Katie patiently taught me the basics one day early in the 2020 pandemic. She told me, "Sexy knitters make squares." As you can see, it's definitely not a square, and Katie kindly suggested ripping it out to get more practice. It was excellent advice that I completely ignored. Screw you Katie, I made this square.
