I had big dreams of learning to crochet and make a pufferfish plushie. I went to JoAnn's and got myself some hooks and three colors of shitty acrylic, which then sat on my shelf and taunted me for two years. My ability to discern yarn quality improved, and the acrylic stayed acrylic. Like a non-zero number of other projects, this hat was born of contempt.

Oh, and it's a Uni Beanie because it's the colors of the University of Oregon. Go ducks! I've never been to Univesity of Oregon.
