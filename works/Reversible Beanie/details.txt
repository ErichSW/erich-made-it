This one was pretty cool! You knit your first row into a crochet chain and then make one side, then rip out the chain and build out the other side, effectively making a football shape. The result is rediculously warm and cushy. While it's technically reversible, I didn't really like the mauve side, so I chose blue as dominant and fixed the two ends together with a pom-pom.
